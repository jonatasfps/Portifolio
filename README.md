## 🚀 Capstone Project – SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction  

### 📌 Abstract  
This project analyzes **SpaceX launch data** to predict Falcon 9 first stage landing success.  
By testing multiple classification models, I examined the influence of **payload mass, launch site, orbit, and booster version** on landing outcomes.  

### 🔑 Key Steps  
- Gathered and prepared SpaceX data using **API calls and web scraping**.  
- Developed machine learning models: **Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, and Decision Tree**.  
- Achieved an accuracy of approximately **87%** with the **Decision Tree and SVM**.  
- Built interactive visualizations with **Plotly Dash** and **Folium maps**.  

### 📈 Key Findings  
- Launches with **lighter payloads** into **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)** showed the highest success probability.  
- **Booster version** and **number of previous flights** were strong predictors of success.  
- Results support SpaceX’s focus on **reusable rocket technology**.
